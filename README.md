                               NITT Event Management System
========================================================================================================================= 
                                    PROBLEM STATEMENT
                                 -------------------------   

There are many events organized by students in NITT in every year. There are some difficulty comes during that time for
booking the place (Halls). Some problems related to Hall booking are as follows:-
     1. Two or more events occur in the same days.
     2. No certain place is available for the specific events.
     3.	Two or more eventâ€™s organizer wants the same place for organizing there events.
     4.	Choosing which place or ground is most convenient for a certain event.
     5.	We can also do this work on paper but this will be a tedious task. 
                   We can remove these problems by using this project
                   --------------------------------------------------
This project is aimed at developing an Event Management system that is of importance to a NITT college. The NITT Events 
Management System is an application that can be accessed throughout the college on Delta server. 
The proposed system can be used for booking the hall rooms which are available in NITT. This project will be able to 
find out which hall is recently vacant on a particular date and if it is vacant on that day then book that day for 
Event.This project is also a user friendly application.This system will reduce a lot of paper work and hence load on 
administrative staff. Machines perform all the calculation therefore the chances of error are nil. Also deletion, 
addition and updating can be performed easily. Another major benefit is that unauthorized access is prevented due 
to ID verification.

                                     Tools/ Platforms to be used
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Since major activities of the project are to store data and generate reports based on stored data,
	we need following software and Hardware for the project.

                        Software Requirement
                      -----------------------
Following type of software is required for the project:-

    1. A good RDBMS with distributed computing support.
    2. A good user-friendly user interface with good report generation capability.
    3. An Operating system that support networking.

This project is based upon Desktop Application Model in which Core Java 1.6  is used as Front End Tools (Menu)
or client side application and Oracle 10g as Back End Tools or Server side application, which is a hardware platform
in which it handles its request and interfaces to a database. Basic purpose of this project is to use the database
with different location for different users.
